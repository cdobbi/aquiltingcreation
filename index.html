                <p>
                    Hello! I'm LeAnn Hill, the owner of A Quilting Creation. I am a longarm quilter with over 30 years of experience in
                    quilting. I have a passion for creating beautiful quilts and helping others bring their quilting visions to life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began my quilting journey in 1993, inspired by my twin aunts who had been freehand quilting for 30 years. Their
                    beautiful quilts captivated me, and I was eager to learn. Despite my persistent requests for lessons, their advice was
                    always the same: "Just take a class."
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first project was a housedress pattern quilt. Although challenging for a beginner, I persevered and completed it
                    after a year. I entered it in the Salt Lake County Fair and won 2nd place in the amateur division. This achievement
                    encouraged me to continue quilting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, I have created numerous quilts and table runners, many of which have been entered in the Fair, given
                    away as gifts, or sold. I have also made specialized quilts for family, friends, neighbors, baby showers, weddings, and
                    all kinds of occasions and holidays.
                </p>
                <p>There really doesn't need to be a reason to make a quilt. For instance, my sister
                    once asked if she could have one of the table runners I made. When I asked her why, she said, "when I look at it, it
                    makes me
                    happy!"
                </p>
                <p>That is the why of quilting!! It does my heart good to provide warmth, beauty, and happiness to those who receive
                    them.
                </p>
